# 🛡️ How to Stay Safe Online

## 🧱 1. Build Strong Password Habits
- Avoid names, birthdays, phone numbers  
- Use random passwords  
- Store them in a password manager  

## 🔐 2. Enable 2FA
Even if someone has your password, 2FA stops them.

## 📲 3. Be Smart About Links
Before clicking:
- Who sent it?
- Does the URL look real?
- Are there spelling mistakes?

## 💬 4. Think Before Sharing
Never post:
- School ID  
- Address  
- Location  
- Personal documents  

## ⚙️ 5. Update Your Apps
Updates fix security bugs.

## 🧘 Bonus: Digital Hygiene
- Don’t download pirated apps  
- Log out on shared devices  
- Avoid unsecured WiFi
